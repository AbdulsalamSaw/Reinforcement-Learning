# Reinforcement Learning with Q-learning for Taxi-v3
# Q-learning for Taxi-v3

This repository contains Python code that implements the Q-learning algorithm to train an agent to navigate the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI Gym.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install gym numpy pandas

2. **Run the Code**
   Run the main script to train the agent and observe the results:
   ```bash
   python main.py

**Overview**
This repository aims to showcase the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm for training an agent to solve the Taxi-v3 problem.

**How Q-learning Works**
Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to find an optimal action-selection policy for a given finite Markov decision process. In the context of this project, the algorithm learns to navigate the Taxi-v3 environment by updating its Q-values based on the rewards obtained from different actions.
